<h1>Google Drive File Stream encountered a problem and has stopped</h1>
<p>Affected: Google Drive Backup &amp; Sync on macOS High Sierra</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit the Drive File Stream app from the top applications bar</li>
<li>Hit <strong>command+space</strong></li>
<li>Type <strong>~/Library/Application Support/Google</strong></li>
<li>Rename <strong>DriveFS</strong> to anything you'd like</li>
<li>Start the Drive File Stream app</li>
<li>Quit Google Chrome. If unresolved, restart Mac.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the reason as to why this error takes place, if you look through the logs located in that DriveFS folder, you'll see the app tries to re-establish streams to files. In our case, there were corrupted streams. By renaming or deleting the DriveFS folder, it forces the Drive File Stream app to recreate the folder and all cache streams.</p>
