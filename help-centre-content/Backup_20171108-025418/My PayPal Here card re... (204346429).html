<h1>My PayPal Here card reader won't power on</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Update 19.09.2016</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">The white PayPal card reader started to become a drag for our business because of three reasons</span></p>
<ol>
<li>battery drain when carried in a bag due to inadvertent button press waking the card reader</li>
<li>pairing to an iPhone running iOS 9 and above was too cumbersome</li>
<li>online and over-the-phone payments were better serviced by Stripe - lower fee, excellent dashboard and automatic sweep to bank account</li>
</ol>
<p>For Point Of Sale or mobile payments, the black <a href="https://www.paypal.com/au/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">contactless PayPal Here card reader</a> could still be worthwhile if the battery and pairing issues are resolved.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Symptoms</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">PayPal Here card reader will not power on when you press side power button, sync or keypad button.</span></li>
<li>Normally when the card reader is turned on, the<img src="https://support.itsolver.net/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202331735/system-icon-bluetooth_InvariantCulture_Default.png" alt="" /> light will flash or steady red triangle.</li>
<li>Solid red triangle means the battery is extremely low and should be charged before any further use.</li>
<li>If the card reader’s PIN light glows a permanent red, the card reader has a low battery and should be charged as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Affected devices</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PayPal Here Card Reader (white) - <em>not </em>the black Tap and Go Mobile Card Reader</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Model: Miura M003-PROD01-V2-7 </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Troubleshoot</span></p>
<p class="contentParagraph">Here are a few things you can try</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wake up your card reader.</strong> Your card reader could be idle. Wake it up by pressing any number on the keypad or the power button.</li>
<li><strong>Charge the card reader.</strong> If the card reader won’t turn on, connect the USB cable to the card reader and a power source and recharge the battery. A full recharge takes approximately 3 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Reset the card reader. </strong>If the card reader still won't turn on, press the reset button next to power button using a small paperclip or iPhone sim card tool. You will need to pair the card reader with your mobile device again and initialise card reader using PayPal Here app.</li>
</ul>
