<h1>How to: Resize VirtualBox disk image [Windows, Mac or Linux]</h1>
<p>When the VirtualBox disk image is created you are asked to set the size and quite often you realise (later on) the size was too small or too large. Here are the commands to resolve so you can grow or shrink the disk image.</p>
<h2>Linux, Mac or Windows as host</h2>
<p>1. Open a Terminal session (or command prompt for Windows users)</p>
<p>2. Type this command and replace the two variables to suit:</p>
<pre>VBoxManage modifyhd {VIRTUAL_DISK_NAME}.vdi --resize {SIZE_IN_MB} </pre>
