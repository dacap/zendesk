<h1>How to: extend the ring time of your Telstra mobile</h1>
<p>By default, your phone rings for 15 seconds before diverting a call to MessageBank® – you can change this using increments of five seconds (up to 30 seconds).</p>
<h3>Extending your ring time</h3>
<p>To extend the ring time, enter the following sequence on your mobile phone:</p>
<pre>**61*101**(number of seconds: 15, 20, 25 or 30)#</pre>
<p>For instance, to extend your ring time to the maximum of 30 seconds:</p>
<pre>**61*101**30#</pre>
<p>Then press the call/send button.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Restoring or removing original settings</h3>
<p>To restore all three conditional call forwarding settings (Busy, No Answer, No Reply) to MessageBank®, enter:</p>
<pre> **004*101#</pre>
<p>To remove all three conditional call forwarding settings (Busy, No Answer, No Reply) to MessageBank®, enter:</p>
<pre> #004#</pre>
<p>Both of these actions will set the default ring time of 15 seconds.</p>
